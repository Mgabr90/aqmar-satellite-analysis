Search Query (copy-paste):
platformname:Sentinel-1 AND          producttype:GRD AND          polarisation:VV+VH AND          sensoroperationalmode:IW AND         beginposition:[2025-03-01T00:00:00.000Z TO 2025-04-30T23:59:59.999Z] AND         footprint:"Intersects(POLYGON((-77.0 36.5,-75.5 36.5,-75.5 37.5,-77.0 37.5,-77.0 36.5)))"

Recommended files to download:
- Look for recent IW_GRDH products
- Prefer ascending passes for consistency
- Download both VV and VH polarizations if available

Save to: sar_data\virginia/
